## Background

Heritability of a trait is often identified and reported in an ancestry group stratified manner. This limits the ability to estimate and report the combined heritability in a multi-ethnic population. Although there are several methods demonstrated recently with robust ways of calculating heritability with or without individual-level datasets, these methods are limited to ancestry-specific groups. In this project, we are proposing a way to calculate combined heritability using a multi-ethnic reference linkage-disequilibrium (LD) panel with equal proportions of data. We will use current existing tools to simulate and calculate heritability and report it as a framework that can be implemented and explored further. This will lead to the development of a novel approach to estimating the heritability of particular traits in multi-ethnic populations. As a part of Team HeriVar, you will be contributing to the demonstration of methodology, calculation of heritability, and work as a team to promote the method.

With the increasing availability of multi-ethnic whole genome sequence datasets, there is a gaping absence of an approach to estimate the heritability of particular phenotypic trait that accounts for the multi-ethnic genetic architecture. This approach of calculating the combined multi-ethnic heritability has not been pursued previously. This project helps us understand the problems facing this issue in the field of genomics and helps in generating a framework using existing tools to calculate and assess the heritability of a trait in multi-ethnic populations.

  - Clone the github of ldsc (git clone https://github.com/bulik/ldsc.git) and cd into the folder
  - Module load Anaconda3 ( module load Anaconda3 ) 
  - Install dependencies using conda as suggested by github ( conda env create --file environment.yml )
  - Activate ldsc ( source activate ldsc )
  - Test installation by running python scripts shared  as path of repo ( ./ldsc.py -h )

  
- Sumher
  - Download the LDAK Linux executable file by requesting using name and email ( you will get an email from the developer with downloadables if you are a first time user )
  - Unzip the executable file and use it. ( /data/project/ubrite/hackathon2022/staging_area_teams/HeriVar/Tools/ldak5.2.linux - It can be accessible by everyone)
  - It also have executable for MAC users. 
    Note: Please check Dependencies before installing the tools.

- LiftOver
  - Download the file from  https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver 
  - Download the chain file needed for conversion - we can download it from above link.
  - Run liftOver -h

## Results

- Datasets
  - We downloaded 1000g high coverage reference dataset from http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20201028_3202_phased/. (cite this)
  - We then extracted individuals files and randomly chose 489 unrelated individuals among each ancestry group.
  - Rationale behind including sample individuals from multiple ancestry groups is by taking equal number of individuals, we can have equal ld pattern distribution among the individuals.
  - Admixed population were excluded from the analysis along with related individuals which to 1956 individuals.
  - We removed variants with less than 1% minor allele frequency and variants with more than 5% missing data.
                          
                                  Allele Frequency Distribution among each ancestry and overall.

- PCA Analysis
  - We used Plink to calculate principal compnents analysis to test whether we have equal distributions of samples per ancestry group.

                                                             PC distributions stratified by Ancestry

- Prunning & Thresholding
   - After subsetting to sample of interest, we did prunning and thresholding based on different cutoffs.
   - Plink is used to generate the files needed.
   - We used R2 and window size parameters for analysis.
      - R-squared cutoff of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8.
      - Window size of 250kb, 500kb, 1Mb, 10Mb.

   -  We had ran near 1000 jobs for generating this datasets in Cheaha.
   -  We decided to exclude High LD regions as recommended by the tools.
   -  We subsetted the datasets to two categories.
       - Pre HighLD regions removal.
       - Post Hight LD regions removal.

- Refernces panel generation
  - We used the two categories as mentioend above and used two tools to calculated reference LD panels.
  - We used ldsc to generate LD scores for all the categories we have.

  - For LDAK annotations, We used liftover to convert  blk annotations from grch37 to grch38 and working on generting tagging files
      - We had an issue generating LDAK annotations files and decided to pursue analysis after hackathon. 
  
 - Phenotypes Processing
    - We have also worked on processing phenotypes based as suggested by the tools.
  
- Heritability 
    - We tried to generate h2 values using LDAK & LDSC but couldnt able to complete because of last minute issues.
